\begin{frame}[t]{Sequential Programming versus Parallel Programming}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textmark{Sequential programming}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Well-known set of \emph{control-structures} embedded in programming languages.
    \item Control structures inherently sequential.
  \end{itemize}
\vfill\pause
\item \textmark{Traditional Parallel programming}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Constructs \emph{adapting} sequential control structures to the parallel world
          (e.g. \emph{parallel-for}).
  \end{itemize}
\vfill\pause
\item But wait!
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What if we had constructs that could be both sequential and parallel?
  \end{itemize}
